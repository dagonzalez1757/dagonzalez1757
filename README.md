## Hi, I’m Diego González

I'm an argentinian **Software Engineer** graduated from [UNLaM](https://www.unlam.edu.ar/).

Currently working as a React developer and interested in growing as a frontend engineer.

Some of the tools I use the most on daily basis:

- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/)
- [Redux/React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
